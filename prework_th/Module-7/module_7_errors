1. Header was not getting treated as a Header
2. Probably not required, but I commented out the instructions

About:
3. The text in the "About" section was not being treated as separate paragraphs
4. Link was not included in the hyperlink section of the code. So the text of the hyperlink was showing without leading to a link

Image:
5. Image was not working correctly
6. May not be a bug, but I reordered the following sections in the same order as the Cat example

Grow / Shrink:
NOTE: I did this by inspecting via Chrome DevTools, so I'm actually not sure what the behavior was before I changed it:
7. I believe the HTML did not include a section at the bottom to link to the JS file
8. I believe quote was missing around the "click" 

Colors:
9. The colors in the html file were not relating to the correct colors

Facts:
10. The array of facts was missing commas / quotes to separate them

List of favorite things:
11. Was missing relevant "li" tags to define the different things as part of a list
