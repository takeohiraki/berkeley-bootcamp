git push origin [branch_name]

3. Merge the branch

#################### Github pages ####################



########## Step 1: Create the repo ##########

1. Create a new repo in Github + initialize with a README.md
2. Name the repo [something]
3. Clone the repo into local and navigate inside of it

########## Step 2: Setup initial files ##########

4. Create an index.html file in the repo <-- required for the deploy to know where to start
5. Push the changes to master:
  - git add .
  - git commit -m "inserting index.html"
  - git push origin master

########## Step 3: Deploy ##########

6. Go to Github --> repo --> settings and change the name of the repo to [something].github.io
7. Change Source --> master branch

Check the link works correctly
  - link format is always https://[username].github.io/[something]





########## ARCHIVE ##########

3. See a list of branches

    git checkout [name_of_branch]

5. Push a commit on a branch

    git push origin [name_of_branch]

6. Merge a branch

    git merge [name_of_branch]/develop

7. Delete a branch 

    git branch -D [name_of_your_new_branch]
